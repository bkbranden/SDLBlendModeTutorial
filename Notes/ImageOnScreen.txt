SDL_Surface
    - An image data type that contains the pixels of an image along with all data needed to render it

    - Just SDL_Surface renders with the CPU

    - Use pointers to SDL Surfaces, 2 reasons:
        * Will dynamically allocate memory to load images

        * Better to reference image by memory location

SDL_GetWindowSurface()
    - Want to show images within the window
        * To do that, must get the image inside the window 
        * Use this to grab the surface contained by the window

Blitting/SDL_BlitSurface()
    - Blitting takes in a source surface and stamps a copy of it into the destination surface 
        * First argument is the source surface
        * Third argument is the destination surface

UpdateSurface
    - After drawing everything we want to show for the current frame, we have to update the screen using
      SDL_UpdateWindowSurface
        * In this case, there are double buffers and sometimes you draw to the buffer in the back
    
    - When making draw calls like SDL_BlitSurface, you render to the back buffer

    - What we see on the screen is the front buffer
    
    - Helpful when draw calls take multiple frames to draw to the screen as this prevents us from seeing unfinished
      draw frames being drawn to the front buffer
