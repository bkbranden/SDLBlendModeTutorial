SDL
	- A dynamically linked library that has 3 parts:
		* Header files (Library.h)
		* Library files (libLibrary.a)
		* Binary files (Library.so)

	- Compiler needs to be able to find the header files when compiling
		* If it complains that it can't find SDL.h, it means that the header files aren't in a place that the compiler looks for header files

	- After the compiler compiles all of the files, it has to link them together 
		* Can either configure the compiler to search in an additional directory wherre
		  SDL lirary files are located
		* Or can put the library files in with the rest of the library files that
		  the compiler comes with
		* If compiler complains that it can't find -lSDL or SDL2.lib it means
		  the library files aren't in a place that the linker looks for library files

Starting a window
	- Always include SDL since the functions and datatypes are needed
	  to make any SDL code
		* First argument to SDL_CreateWindow is the window's caption or title
		* Next two arguments define the x and y position the window is created in
		* Next two arguments define the window's width and height
		* Final argument are the creation flags
			- SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN makes sure the window is shown when created

SDL_GetError()
	- Very useful function, whenever something goes wrong and
	  you need to know why, SDL_GetError() will let you know if any errors
	  happened inside of any SDL function
